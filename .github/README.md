## Snake
* **PLATFORM**: Windows
* **LANGUAGE**: C++
* **ENVIRONMENT**: Visual Studio

## Description
Snake is a classic retro game where players control a 'snake' and attempt to eat all the 'apples' on the screen without colliding with their own body. The size of the snakes body increases with each apple eaten making the game gradually more difficult as the game goes on. This game was developed using C++ and the SDL2 library. Snake is another personal project of mine which was created to further develop my C++ and game development skills.

## Control Scheme
- Movement: ARROW KEYS
